Abstract

Supply chain visibility is a concept that aims to identify and visualize supply chains across all tiers. Companies require a comprehensive understanding of their supply chain, including both customers and suppliers, to enhance decision-making capabil- ities and respond swiftly to any disruptions. However, information is only available about direct customers and suppliers; all other stages are usually hidden. As a result, many companies are not prepared for sudden changes and make poor deci- sions. Especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the awareness of resilient supply chains has increased significantly. With greater visibility comes bet- ter decision-making capabilities, improved responsiveness, and greater safety across all areas of operations: ultimately resulting in diminished risks of disruption or unpreparedness within enterprises.

This thesis aims to explore the potential for open commercial databases to bridge existing gaps within currently available information on global supply chains. A comprehensive review of current literature was undertaken to gain an understanding of the rapidly evolving field of supply chain management and various methods used in web scraping for the successful extraction of complex data. The extracted data will be transformed into a visually intuitive format to increase clarity and understanding of complicated supply chains. This form of presentation allows organizations to easily interpret the information.

This study examines the practical implications of employing web scraping techniques, integrating databases, and utilizing visualization tools to enhance informed decision-making in the corporate context. To prove its usefulness in achieving productive results, a range of real-world applications and case studies from major cor- porations such as Airbus, BMW, Tesla, and Intel are presented to demonstrate how data extraction workflows can be used to improve supply chain visibility. Overall this study highlights the potential of these technologies in leveraging public data to understand intricate supply chain networks in order to make informed decisions about business operations with greater efficiency.

Finally, the proposed approach for improving supply chain resilience in businesses is evaluated, highlighting its strengths and identifying limitations. It also suggests po- tential areas of future research to equip businesses with methods and tools necessary to strengthen their response to Idiosyncratic shocks in supply chain networks.
