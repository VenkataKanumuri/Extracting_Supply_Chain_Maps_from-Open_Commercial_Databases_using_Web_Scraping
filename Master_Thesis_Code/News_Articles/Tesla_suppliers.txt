Title: Elon Musk’s Tesla plans to launch electricity supplier in Britain
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/12/elon-musk-tesla-electric-supplier-britain
Content: Elon Musk’s Tesla is poised to disrupt Britain’s energy market with the launch of a new household supplier. The maker of electric cars, which also runs an energy supply business in the US, plans to begin selling electricity to homes and running “virtual power plants”, according to a recent job listing. The listing for Tesla Electric, which supplies electricity to households that own Tesla products such as cars or batteries, called for a new executive “with a healthy scepticism of the status quo” to manage the company’s entry into the UK market. The advert for a head of operations, which was first reported by the Daily Telegraph, said Tesla Electric would be able to “support the transition of the entire electricity grid to 100% renewables”. It is understood that Tesla may be planning to help customers who own a Tesla Powerwall battery, solar panels or one of its electric vehicles to store electricity when it is cheap, and sell electricity back to the grid when market prices are higher. This can help households avoid peaks in market prices when renewable electricity is in short supply, and help the grid do without fossil fuels by making better use of renewable electricity. Tesla first launched its household supply deals in Texas late last year, and offered drivers who bought its Model 3 car between May and June a year of free, overnight vehicle charging at home when they signed up with Tesla Electric as their retail electricity provider. After the first year, drivers would default to Tesla’s standard overnight charging rate of $1 a day. Tesla took its first step into the British market three years ago by applying to the energy regulator for Great Britain to be an electricity generator. Ofgem granted its licence in June 2020. At the time, industry observers speculated that Tesla might be planning to build large-scale battery storage projects in the UK, after its success building a 100MW storage scheme in less than 100 days in Australia. A generation licence would also allow Tesla to aggregate customers across the country and, in effect, create a virtual power plant. Similar tariffs for households with batteries or solar panels are already available from suppliers including Octopus Energy and Ovo Energy. Earlier this year, Tesla set out a “master plan” to eliminate fossil fuels from the world economy by relying on electrification and smart power storage technologies. Tesla’s report found that a sustainable energy economy was “technically feasible” and would require “less investment and less material extraction” than continuing to support an unsustainable energy economy. The company’s call to revolt against the fossil fuel industry by eliminating fossil fuels through a “hugely and politically difficult” carbon tax would not extend to Musk’s SpaceX venture.

Title: Strikes suspended at UK munitions plant that supplies missiles to Ukraine
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/17/strikes-suspended-at-uk-munitions-plant-that-supplies-missiles-to-ukraine
Content: A two-week strike due to hit a British munitions plant that supplies missiles to Ukraine has been suspended after the Ministry of Defence agreed to talks. Nearly 50 workers at the site at Beith, in Ayrshire, which assembles the Storm Shadow and Brimstone missiles, had been due to walk out for a fortnight next Monday in a long-running row over pay and bonuses. Strikes by GMB members were the first in the history of Defence Equipment &amp; Support, the MoD agency that handles the military’s supplies, equipment and weapons and runs the Beith site. It is thought the MoD will table new proposals to improve pay and bonuses for GMB members who carry out “non-craft” roles such as handling and loading the missiles. Their higher-skilled craft colleagues employed to assemble the weapons, as well as site managers, are thought to be paid up to £18,000 a year more after DE&amp;S increased their salaries to stop them quitting for higher-paid private sector defence jobs. The two sides will hold talks at the Acas arbitration and conciliation service in an effort to strike a deal. An MoD spokesperson said: “We are referring this dispute to Acas’s conciliation service, which will help us explore potential opportunities that we can agree on to find a resolution. This is a voluntary process and is a clear measure of our willingness and intent to engage constructively and productively with GMB to resolve this issue.” A GMB Scotland official said: “We won’t have any new information until the meeting in three weeks but Acas made clear only decision-makers should attend and the assumption is that they won’t come empty-handed. The convention is to give them a chance and assume good faith.” The MoD has said the industrial action would not hit shipments to Ukraine, and said it had contingency plans in place to ensure the smooth running of the plant if the strike went ahead. The GMB’s industrial action began in July with a series of one-day stoppages and won support from Ukrainian trade unions, a Ukrainian opposition MP and the Scottish National party’s defence spokesperson, Dave Doogan. Doogan had urged Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, to intervene. Louise Gilmour, the GMB’s Scotland secretary, said: “A two-tier culture has been allowed to embed itself in this workplace and risks good working relationships now and in the future. Our members are doing important and responsible jobs and simply want that work to be fairly recognised. Instead, they have seen the gap between their salaries and that of their colleagues stretch wider and wider.” • This article was amended on 17 August 2023. An earlier version misnamed Dave Doogan, the SNP’s defence spokesperson, as David Duggan.

Title: What Apple did to Nokia, Tesla is now doing to the motor industry | John Naughton
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/05/apple-nokia-tesla-motor-industry-electric-vehicles-cars
Content: An intriguing news item dropped into my inbox this week. It said that in the first quarter of this year, an electric vehicle (EV) had become the biggest-selling car in the world, outselling the Toyota Corolla. I know, I know, dear reader: you think this is non-news of the “Small earthquake in Chile, not many dead” variety. But to those of us condemned to follow the tech industry, three things are significant about it: the vanquished car was a Corolla, the EV was a Tesla (the Model Y hatchback), and the runner-up is made by Toyota. The poor Corolla gets a lot of disdainful looks from petrolheads, who tell rude jokes about it and view the vehicle as bland, unimaginative and boring. Normal people, however, have consistently regarded it as one of the best compact cars available, with good fuel economy, impressive reliability and excellent luggage capacity. And they have backed that judgment with their wallets for many years. So on the sales front, the Corolla was no pushover. Despite that, it was overtaken by, of all things, a Tesla. When Elon Musk and his co-founders embarked on making cars in 2004-5, their first product was the Roadster – an expensive premium sports car (based on a Lotus Elite chassis) that was aimed at wealthy early adopters (AKA Silicon Valley geeks) with more money than sense. From the beginning, though, Musk – with characteristic bravado – insisted that the company’s long-term strategic goal was to create affordable mass-market electric vehicles – mainstream cars, including saloons and affordable compacts. At the time, many of us (including this columnist) found that pretty hubristic. So did the automobile industry as a whole, reacting with incredulity or scepticism, or both. After all, this was a huge global industry dominated by the likes of Toyota, VW, Hyundai/Kia, Ford, General Motors, Porsche, Mercedes and BMW – corporations that had mastered the difficult art of making these complex products on a huge scale, and had been doing it for half a century or more. Sure, Tesla might have a future making exotic, expensive, specialised cars – like Jaguar in the old days, maybe. But as a mass-manufacturer of cars that ordinary people would buy? Give us a break. And yet here we are. Funnily enough, news of the Corolla being eclipsed triggered memories of another news item – one that emerged in the summer of 2007. It was that Apple, then a small but plucky computer manufacturer, had developed a phone! The response of the global mobile phone industry (comprising manufacturers and telecoms networks) was amused incredulity. Sure (the reaction went), Steve Jobs’s iPhone seemed smart and innovative – a handheld computer with an internet connection that could also make voice calls. But the device didn’t have a proper keyboard and you couldn’t even replace the battery! Besides, the idea that a computer company with no experience of mobiles could break into a huge industry dominated by companies such as Nokia – which built great kit and knew what it was doing – was fanciful. Well, we know how that story played out. Most of the 5bn or so mobile phones in use around the world now are smartphones based on the iPhone model: handheld computers with an internet connection that can also make voice calls. Of course, it didn’t happen overnight. Among other things, the smartphone revolution wouldn’t have been possible without ubiquitous mobile broadband and the construction of the global infrastructure of colossal datacentres that make cloud computing possible. But, for good or ill, it happened. Hindsight is famously the only exact science, so it’s easy to mock incumbent industries for fudging the future. And history never repeats itself exactly. But there are some interesting similarities emerging between the tech and automobile industries in this area. Nokia, for example, was a great company, but it was founded on the idea that it was the hardware of a phone that mattered most, with software coming a poor second. The iPhone/smartphone model had it the other way round. Toyota, in its turn, was (and still is) a great company. After all, it invented “the Lean Machine” – the way all internal combustion engine (ICE) cars are manufactured today. And modern ICE cars are governed by software to some extent. But you can’t make an EV just by taking out the engine and replacing it with an electric motor and a battery in place of the fuel tank: you have to rethink the entire concept, much as Apple re-envisioned the mobile phone. In crude terms, an EV is essentially a giant skateboard: the battery is the board, with motors and wheels on the four corners, and the whole machine is orchestrated by networked computers. Think of it as software with wheels. Which of course then raises the question: is Toyota the new Nokia? The answer is up to Toyota. I just popped in to a dealer to see its first real EV: the bZ4X. It’s an SUV and ugly in the way all SUVs are. But at least it’s a skateboard. And cheaper than a Tesla. What I’ve been reading Stagnating empire “Britain is a developing country.” Brusquely realistic diagnosis by Sam Bowman on Substack. Machine learning “An ‘Oppenheimer Moment’ for the Progenitors of AI” is an interesting essay in Noema by Nathan Gardels on the film in relation to current worries about AI.

Title: Tesla beats Wall Street expectations to produce record number of vehicles
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/19/tesla-q2-2023-earnings-production-report-elon-musk
Content: Tesla narrowly beat Wall Street expectations in the second quarter of 2023, but shares began to fall in after hours trading following an earnings call that offered shareholders little reassurance surrounding Tesla’s promised Cybertruck release and other production concerns. Revenue for the quarter topped $24.97bn compared with analyst predictions of $24.7bn. The report comes after Tesla slashed costs for its most popular vehicle models and drove a major increase in sales. Earnings were $0.91 a share compared with estimates of $0.79. Investors were closely watching Tesla’s gross margins, monitoring if they were negatively affected by the company’s move to decrease consumer prices. The gross margin for the quarter was at 18.2% – representing a four-year low for Tesla but still higher than analyst expectations of 17.5%. “Despite lower car prices, the company managed to mitigate the already-expected decline in margins, showcasing Elon Musk’s adeptness at steering the company through both prosperous and challenging times,” said Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at financial analysis site Investing.com. Tesla produced 460,211 Model 3 compact cars and Model Y sport-utility vehicles – its mass-market models – compared with 345,988 in the same quarter last year and 19,489 deliveries of its Model S and Model X premium vehicles, compared with 16,411 at the same time last year. Tesla shares initially rose marginally in after-hours trading following the promising report. But investors, who have been anxious for updates about Tesla’s Cybertruck model, may have been underwhelmed by executive responses about the sci-fi-inspired vehicle on the call. The truck was announced in 2019 and has yet to reach the market. Earlier this week, Tesla posted an image on social media celebrating “the first Cybertruck built at Giga Texas!” But Musk said on the call that the company had only produced a “release candidate” model of the Cybertruck and that the vehicle is still in “tooling” phase. Musk reiterated that the model was on track for initial deliveries in 2023 and “high volume” distribution in 2024. As is typical with Tesla earnings calls, Musk rattled off a number of lofty goals. In addition to stating the Cybertruck would be released by the end of the year, he said he saw a path to a “five or 10 times increase in valuation of Tesla” over time. He promised Tesla’s self-driving technology would be “10 times – possibly 100 times – safer than a human driver”. He also said Tesla was in talks with a major automaker about licensing the company’s full self-driving technology. “This is a big deal,” he said in a follow up tweet about the announcement. Such a move would not be unprecedented, as Nissan, Ford and GM have partnered with Tesla to share the company’s electronic vehicle chargers in the past year. Musk argued that Tesla’s artificial intelligence capabilities would create a full self-driving vehicle technology that would be difficult to compete with, opening the market for AI-focused partnerships. With shares falling in after-hours trading, it seems that participants on the call were perhaps not won over by Musk’s promises. Shareholders have previously expressed concern that Musk, who also owns SpaceX, Neuralink and Twitter, is stretched too thin in his leadership role. Musk announced the creation of yet another company this month, xAI, which he described as a “pro-humanity” artificial intelligence firm that will develop technology to be integrated at both Twitter and Tesla. AI was a large focus of the earnings call, after Tesla said in its Wednesday report that to reach its goal of fully-autonomous vehicles, it must develop “four main pillars” at scale: “extremely large real-world datasets, neural net training, vehicle hardware and vehicle software”. In keeping with this goal, the company said it was starting production of Dojo – its neural net training computer that Musk first announced in 2021. Musk said in the call on Wednesday he anticipates Tesla will spend more than $1bn in the next year on Dojo, adding to concerns about the company’s expenditures and its gross margin.

Title: Australia to send surveillance aircraft to Germany to help protect supplies to Ukraine
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/10/australia-to-send-surveillance-aircraft-to-germany-to-help-protect-supplies-to-ukraine
Content: The Australian government will send a surveillance aircraft to Germany to help monitor the flow of military and humanitarian supplies into Ukraine. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced the deployment after talks with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin on Monday, a day before attending a Nato summit in Lithuania where the war in Ukraine will dominate discussions. Albanese also confirmed previous reports that Australia would join the German-led Climate Club, a new international grouping that is expected to focus on reducing emissions in heavy industry and bringing “green steel” and “green hydrogen” onto the market quickly. The Royal Australian Air Force plans to deploy an E-7A Wedgetail aircraft for six months from October with a mission of protecting multinational logistics hubs that supply critical support to Ukraine. Officials said the aircraft, to be based in Germany, would “help to ensure the continued and uninterrupted flow of military and humanitarian assistance into Ukraine” by giving an early warning of any threats. The Wedgetail, based on the Boeing 737-700, features a long-range surveillance radar and is equipped to simultaneously track airborne and maritime targets, according to the RAAF. It is to be deployed as part of Operation Kudu – which to date has been the name given to the efforts by Australian defence force personnel currently deployed to the United Kingdom to train Ukrainian army recruits. Australian officials emphasised that the Wedgetail would operate in European airspace and not within Ukraine, Russia or Belarus. The deployment will include up to 100 crew and support personnel. The commitment comes amid renewed calls from the Coalition for the Albanese government to step up its contribution to Ukraine, two weeks after Australia announced another $110m assistance package, which did not include some of the items that Kyiv had requested. “We stand with the people of Ukraine,” Albanese told reporters near the Brandenburg Gate on Monday, prior to the meeting with Scholz. “This is a war about the international rule of law, about whether a large nation can seek to impose its will on a smaller nation. This is about national sovereignty. This is about the people of Ukraine struggling to defend their democracy and their sovereignty.” Albanese distanced himself from the former Labor prime minister Paul Keating, who labelled the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, a “supreme fool” as the alliance increases its attention on China and the broader Indo-Pacific region. Albanese said Stoltenberg was a “friend of Australia”, adding that the Australian government supported “the extraordinary effort that Nato is showing because this is a struggle that has implications for the whole world”. Albanese said it was a matter for the alliance whether it opened a new liaison office in Japan – an idea not favoured by the French government – but said Australia was participating at the two-day Nato summit constructively for the second year in a row. “I’m interested in looking forward,” he said. Defence cooperation was one of the main items on the agenda during the meeting between the two leaders in Berlin. Hours earlier, Albanese witnessed the signing of an agreement between senior officials for Australia to export more than 100 Boxer heavy weapon carriers to Germany. They are to be produced in Ipswich, south-west of Brisbane, by the German company Rheinmetall. Albanese invited the German chancellor to visit Australia next year. “We discussed ways to draw our countries even more closely together, with a focus on trade, the clean economy, defence and regional security,” he said in a statement after the meeting. “Australia and Germany are forging ahead with our green agenda, and seizing the exciting opportunities of clean energy transition while delivering new jobs and export opportunities for both countries.” The Climate Club was a German-backed initiative launched after the G7 meeting last year. Australia joins other members including the EU, France, the UK, the US and Indonesia.

Title: Workers at UK munitions plant that supplies Ukraine to strike over pay
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/workers-at-uk-munitions-plant-that-supplies-ukraine-to-strike-over-pay
Content: Workers at a munitions plant that supplies Ukraine with missiles are going on strike for two weeks in an escalating dispute over pay and bonuses. Nearly 50 workers who handle and load missiles at the defence munitions plant at Beith, in Ayrshire, allege they have been significantly short-changed by a pay and bonuses deal given to rocket-assembly staff at the plant. The Beith site assembles and distributes the Storm Shadow and Brimstone missiles being sent to Ukraine by the Ministry of Defence, which said the strikes would not affect supplies for the war. The strike by GMB members, which has already involved several one-day stoppages over the past four weeks, is the first to hit Defence Equipment &amp; Support, the MoD’s supplies, equipment and weapons agency. The GMB said its members, who carry out “non-craft” roles, are now earning up to £18,000 less each year than skilled employees after DE&amp;S significantly increased the pay package for skilled staff to avoid them being recruited by private defence firms. “A two-tier culture has been allowed to embed itself in this workplace and risks good working relationships now and in the future,” said Louise Gilmour, GMB Scotland secretary. “Everyone brings different skills to their work and that should be recognised, but the role of our members is fundamental to the effective operation of this important site. They are only asking for fairness, and the support they have received from Scotland to Ukraine shows why they deserve it.” The MoD said contingency plans were in place to ensure the two-week strike, which takes place later in August, would not disrupt the plant’s operations. “These strikes will have no effect on our ability to provide capability to Ukraine. Pre-planned contingency measures are being implemented at DM Beith to ensure the continued safe and compliant operation of the site,” a spokesperson said. “We remain open to dialogue with GMB to discuss the issues raised and work towards resolving them.” The GMB said it had won support for the dispute from Ukrainian trade unions and a Ukrainian opposition MP and lawyer, Lesia Vasylenko, who has supported calls for Russia to be expelled from the UN. The union released a letter from Mykhailo Volynets, chair of the Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Ukraine, that said the staff at Beith played “a crucial role” in supplying Ukraine with munitions. “The supplies you ensure are a lifesaver for civilians in cities under constant attack by Russian forces, as well as for the brave Ukrainian military on the frontline,” Volynets wrote. “We sincerely appreciate your commitment to supporting Ukrainian workers during the hard times and stand in solidarity with union members in their struggle. We urge the employer to negotiate to resolve the problem as soon as possible.” In a statement issued by the GMB, Vasylenko urged DE&amp;S executives to settle the dispute. “The work being done by GMB Scotland members at Beith could not be more important to Ukraine as we fight for our freedom,” she said. DE&amp;S, which employs 11,500 people, recently came under intense criticism from MPs on the Conservative-led defence select committee at the House of Commons. Mark Francois, the Tory MP who led the committee’s inquiry, said the MoD’s defence procurement systems were “broken” and in need of wholesale reform, a change made more acute and pressing by the war in Ukraine. “Bureaucratic, siloed and slow-moving – this is a dysfunctional system that has left multiple programmes floundering in its wake. This urgently needs to change,” he said. His complaints were rejected by the MoD, which said ministers were spending an extra £5bn over the next two years “to improve readiness and resilience”.

Title: ‘Shock to the system’: Asics halts supplies to UK independent sports shops
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/26/shock-to-the-system-asics-halts-supplies-to-uk-independent-sports-shops
Content: When Dipu Patel, the owner of Euro Sports in north London, received an email from Asics telling him it would no longer supply him with trainers, it was the latest hammer blow to hit the independent retailer. Sales of the Japanese footwear brand, which makes tennis star Novak Djokovic’s trainers, comprise 40% of Patel’s footwear sales at his sports shop in Swiss Cottage. Patel received an email last month telling him supplies would be halted from January. “It’s a shock to the system,” he said. “We will be losing [Asics] customers – they will buy it online. [Asics] have used us as a stepping stone to be where they are and then are going to sell direct.” Independent sports retailers have said their businesses are under threat after Asics said it was cutting off supply to hundreds of small UK outlets, joining Nike and Adidas in ditching smaller retailers in favour of big chains and selling direct online. Patel said Euro Sports bought more than £40,000 of footwear a year from Asics even when the brand introduced restrictions on orders because of restrictions in supply linked to factory shutdowns caused by the Covid pandemic. “We had to let Nike go, but their range is mainly fashion shoes now. We built Asics up over the year as the specialist shoe, and to have that taken away is a bitter pill to swallow,” said Patel. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Asics said it was halting supplies from next year after “reassessing the relationship with many of our customers”. It is a hefty blow to hundreds of specialist retailers already suffering from rising costs and weakening demand since the pandemic surge in sales of sports kit. Some larger independent retailers have been cut off by Asics, which sent out emails last month, but other smaller ones have been left in place leaving stockists scratching their heads as to the criteria Asics has used to slim down its distribution. Several retailers said they had sought more information but not received a reply. Asics has become an important brand for many independent retailers in recent years after Nike and Adidas stopped supplying many smaller outlets to focus on their own stores and websites or major chains such as Sports Direct and JD Sports in the UK. One independent running shop owner said she had been kept on by Asics but Nike had recently told her it would stop selling her its running spikes, leaving few alternatives. “They want to push everybody to their online store,” she said. Nick Mavrides at Ace Sports in Kentish Town, north London, said at least 30% of his sales were reliant on Asics. “Our business is under threat. Everything in our running range is Asics from a child’s size 10 to a men’s 14. It is a massive part of our business. They are following in the footsteps of Adidas and Nike.” He said the government should be taking a look at the issue with supplies for smaller stores saying the situation with big sports brands was like “going to your local corner shops and finding they don’t stock Kelloggs Cornflakes”. Mavrides suggested Asics had only stuck with independent retailers in smarter areas. “It’s like saying that anyone in NW5 is not worthy of their goods as they are not posh enough,” he said. James Ellis of the Run Company, which has four stores in Brighton, Chichester, Southampton and Woking, said Asics gear made up about a fifth of his sales. He said losing Asics came at a tricky time as the cost of living crisis and a shift away from the lockdown leap in exercising had dampened interest in buying sports gear. “It has been very challenging. It’s all against the retailer.” He said Asics would be replaced by smaller names and the brand was likely to try to return to independent retail when it realised it was hard to win over new fans and keep long-term customers without a trusted relationship with expert sellers who could fit specialist shoes. “They will come back hoping to open those doors back up,” he said, “or someone will come in and fill their space.” Asics did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: Man hoping to break record for living on Rockall asks for extra supplies
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/13/man-hoping-to-break-record-for-living-on-rockall-asks-for-extra-supplies
Content: An adventurer who plans to break the record for living on Rockall, an isolated islet roughly 230 miles west of the Outer Hebrides, has sent home a shopping list for extra supplies – including a kilogram of fast-setting cement and a radio. Cam Cameron, a Scottish teacher and former soldier, has been occupying a tiny guano-flecked ledge on Rockall since 30 May in the hope he can survive there for up to 60 days. For the past 11 days, Cameron, 53, from Wiltshire, has been there on his own after two companions, radio operators who took part in the first week of the expedition to help him raise money for military charities, returned to the mainland. Cameron said his greatest frustration was forgetting to pack a shortwave radio so he could talk to his friends and family; his satellite-enabled laptop has been erratic, making it far harder than he expected to communicate with home. He could also pick up music and the weather forecast – Rockall is famously one of the Met Office’s maritime forecast zones. It is exposed to huge winter storms, with waves powerful enough to make the 17.5-metre-high rock vibrate on impact. He has been relying on sporadic calls via WhatsApp and text messages, so has asked Harry Brayford, his friend on the mainland helping to coordinate the mission, to see whether any ships or mariners planning to be in the area can help. There were “many things I now wish I had packed but thought better of it”, Cameron said via text message. “Radio is the biggest regret. I do have one but I was so preoccupied with logistics and transport and funding and weather that I forgot about what I personally needed for the trip. For my own comfort and sanity.” His only company on Hall’s Ledge, which measures 4 metres by 1.5 metres, are the cacophonous seabirds that inhabit Rockall; their guano and nests “stink”, he said. Their presence also raises the risk of contracting bird flu, he has been warned. “It is an amazing place. It’s just literally a dream come true,” he added. “The weather over the last few days has been damp, foggy and with some wind. It’s not been the blazing hot sunshine we got for the first few days.” Cameron has had two visits so far: on 4 June the Scottish marine protection vessel Hirta came by. They “dropped me off a lovely Red Cross parcel”, he said. “So nice to see them. Also SY Boomerang with her skipper Eddie stopped off on 7 June but no one since.” The Rockall expedition has become famous among sailors and ham radio enthusiasts after Cameron’s companions, Adrian “Nobby” Styles and Emil Bertsmann, broadcast to 7,300 hams worldwide while they were on the rock. Brayford said he was putting the word out. “The shopping list he sent me is quite extensive. Amazon doesn’t deliver out there,” Brayford said. As well as fresh toiletries, “he wants a hammer, a chisel and a kilo of cement. There’s no Screwfix on Rockall”. One of Cameron’s projects on Rockall, which was annexed by the Royal Navy in 1955 to the anger of the Irish, Danish and Icelandic governments, is to repair and affix signs that mark his and previous occupations, including one given to him by Nick Hancock, whose 45-day occupation record Cameron is hoping to beat. Hence the appeal for extra materials. Alongside his daily diary for a book he plans to write about the expedition, Cameron is writing poetry. He recorded his first effort, called the Rock of Salvation and dedicated to his temporary home, in the style and voice of his country music hero Johnny Cash, with a chorus of seabirds audible in the background. One verse reads: It’s so far out of god damn anywhere it ain’t even on the chart And if you want to get there soon, you better make a start It don’t even have a zip code, so don’t bother sending mail There’s no school or store or hospital, in case you’re feeling frail. There’s no church to pray to god, no place to play guitar And the thing that strikes most folks as odd Is this place ain’t got no bar But the damndest thing about it all is folks dream of landing here And the risk of dying from a fall, to conquer all their fear

Title: Aid agencies in Sudan plead with factions to allow supplies to reach needy
URL: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/03/aid-agencies-in-sudan-plead-with-factions-to-allow-supplies-to-reach-needy
Content: Aid agencies are pleading with battling factions in Sudan to allow humanitarian assistance to reach the needy, after six trucks of humanitarian supplies were looted and airstrikes in Khartoum undermined a new ceasefire. Martin Griffiths, the UN’s emergency relief coordinator, said on Wednesday he was seeking assurances that would allow for movement of staff and supplies. “We will need to have agreement at the highest level and very publicly and we will need to deliver those commitments into local arrangements that can be depended on,” Griffiths told reporters in Port Sudan, the eastern coastal city which has become a base for many aid agencies after nearly three weeks of fighting. There appears little prospect of any real calm in Sudan in the near future. Fierce street fighting, including the use of heavy weaponry and artillery fire, have continued in central Khartoum despite a series of supposed ceasefires, and there have been intense clashes in the restive south-western region of Darfur. A notable casualty on Wednesday was one of Sudan’s most famous actors. Asia Abdelmajid was in her 70s and the widow of Sudan’s acclaimed poet Mohamed Moftah al-Faitory. A former teacher, she was killed by a stray bullet in her house in Khartoum North. The Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group loyal to Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, have blamed the Sudanese armed forces for violating the current ceasefire with strikes on factories and medical facilities. The SAF, led by the country’s de facto leader, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, reject the charge, accusing the RSF infiltrating the homes of soldiers and detaining their families. Both factions have said they are open to sending negotiators for talks in Saudi Arabia, with discussions limited initially to how to enforce a ceasefire amid fighting that has left more than 500 people dead. The true number of casualties is unknown as most hospitals are unable to function fully; a medical union described piles of bodies left in the streets as fighting continued around them. The envoy of Burhan said on Wednesday that the army “accepted the Saudi-US initiative for truce talks, not mediation to end the fighting”. Dafallah Alhaj told reporters in Cairo that their delegation “will not meet with RSF face to face”. The continued violence has led to an exodus of international humanitarian workers and the suspension of most aid programmes. It has also blocked new aid deliveries in a nation where about one-third of the 45 million population already relied on humanitarian assistance. Main international airports remain shut. A broader disaster could be in the making as Sudan’s impoverished neighbours grapple with the influx of refugees. About 100,000 people have been forced to flee with little food or water to neighbouring countries, while in Sudan the price of basic commodities – such as bottled water, food staples, and fuel – has doubled or even tripled in some places. Griffiths said he had been told by the World Food Programme that six of their trucks travelling to Darfur were looted en route despite assurances of safety and security. There was no immediate comment from WFP. “It’s a volatile environment, so we need those commitments,” Griffiths said. “It’s not as if we’re asking for the moon. We’re asking for the movement of humanitarian supplies, of people. We do this in every other country, even without ceasefires. It’s a traditional humanitarian enterprise to go where others don’t.” Leni Christine Kinzli, a WFP communications officer, told the Guardian that one of the biggest current challenges for the agency was that its food stores in Sudan had been looted. In the city of Geneina about 6,800 tonnes of food assistance was stolen and overall the agency estimated its losses at $400m worth of humanitarian assets, including equipment. “We do still have food stocks positioned across the country – around 8,000 metric tonnes – which we are hoping to move to locations to where people are being displaced and where there are already existing refugees or IDP camps,” said Kinzli. “We are focusing on resuming food distributions in al-Gazira, Kassala, the White Nile states … Food distributions have started today and we are doing our best to get assistance to the people that need the most.” Other agencies are also struggling. The ICRC said its first airlift of vital medical supplies landed in Port Sudan on Sunday but has warned of difficulties in transporting aid to hospitals on the frontlines in the capital. The 8 tonnes of humanitarian cargo includes surgical material to support Sudanese hospitals and volunteers from the Sudan Red Crescent Society (SRCS) who are providing medical care to people wounded in the fighting. ICRC officials said on Wednesday that they had “high hopes” of getting the cargo to those who needed it most. However, security concerns for humanitarian workers remain acute with some describing staff facing “enormous personal risks”. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) described a “hell on earth” in Geneina, Darfur, where fighting has resulted in the loss of at least 191 lives. The casualties included a community volunteers with the organisation. The NRC office and guesthouse were also been looted. “The killing of scores of civilians and the complete disrespect for civilian infrastructure is unacceptable. The stories coming out of there describe a hell on earth where displaced families see their precarious shelters turned to ashes, humanitarian offices looted, warehouses pillaged, and nothing is left,” said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the NRC. Evacuation operations by western and other nations are now winding down. The final UK rescue flight from Sudan arrived in the UK on Wednesday afternoon. More than 2,400 people have been evacuated on 29 flights, according to UK officials, who described its evacuations as “the longest and largest operation of any western nation”.

Title: Tesla delivers record number of cars as price cuts lift sales

Content: Tesla delivered a record number of vehicles in the second quarter, as its strategy to cut prices drove a sharp increase in sales of its most popular electric vehicles. The carmaker, which is run by the Twitter and Space X owner Elon Musk, delivered 466,000 vehicles in the three months to the end of June. The company, which beat an average analyst forecast of 455,000 deliveries, delivered 10% more vehicles than in the first quarter and 83% more than the same period last year. The world’s most valuable carmaker, with a market value of $820bn, said it also produced 480,000 vehicles in the quarter. “The price cuts [were] a smart poker move for Tesla and are paying major dividends in the field especially for the China market,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “Tesla continues to play chess while other electric vehicle players are playing checkers and this was another trophy case quarter for Musk and co.” Tesla, which cut prices at the start of the year to boost demand, has set an ambitious target of increasing volumes by an average of 50% a year. “A vast number of people want to buy a Tesla car but can’t afford it,” said Musk, speaking in January. “These price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.” The Tesla Model 3 saloon is priced from $32,740 after federal tax credits worth $7,500. The company delivered 446,915 Model 3 compact cars and Model Y sport-utility vehicle – Tesla’s mass-market models. It also made 19,225 deliveries of its Model S and Model X premium vehicles. Deliveries of its much-hyped Cybertruck, Tesla’s rival in the pickup truck sector, are due to begin this quarter. This year Tesla received a boost as General Motors, Ford, Volvo and Amazon-backed Rivian agreed to adopt its battery-charging standards.
